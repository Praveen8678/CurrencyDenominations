 Problem
 -------
 
Assume you are working on a large Java enterprise application. Your requirement is to build a feature to
take in a balance and convert it into denominations (bills/coins). The intent is to convert the balance
into the least number of bills/coins. The balance is expressed as the lowest unit of currency (e.g. pennies
for USD).
Examples:
Given the balance 87, the function will return 3 Quarters, 1 Dime, 2 Pennies.
Given the balance 287, the function will return 2 Dollars, 3 Quarters, 1 Dime, 2 Pennies.
